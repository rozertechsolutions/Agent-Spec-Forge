# Web Development — Mistral Vibe

## Department overview

The Web Development department is a stack-aware Vibe Code package for frontend, backend, full-stack architecture, APIs, authentication, accessibility, performance, SEO, testing, security, privacy, and release-readiness work. It is not tied to one framework. Components are applicability-based: a task may use the coordinator, one specialist, several reviewers, or only a Skill.

## Possible uses

- Discover an existing web stack before changing it.
- Plan a web feature or migration.
- Review frontend semantics, state, forms, responsiveness, and browser behavior.
- Design or review APIs, authentication, sessions, cookies, CSP, CORS, and privacy boundaries.
- Debug web regressions from repository evidence.
- Audit accessibility, performance, responsive behavior, and SEO.
- Review dependencies and supply-chain risk.
- Prepare release-readiness evidence without deploying.
- Review architecture and migration decisions.

## Supported product surface

This package targets Mistral Vibe Code CLI project configuration. Official Vibe documentation describes project-level custom agents in `./.vibe/agents/`, prompt files referenced by `system_prompt_id`, project Skills in `./.vibe/skills/`, and project `AGENTS.md` discovery from trusted folders. The CLI can run with Mistral-hosted models, configured API plans, or local model setups according to the user's Vibe installation. This repository package is static configuration; it does not install Vibe, authenticate, configure a provider, run Vibe, or prove product loading.

## Included native components

- `AGENTS.md`: project-level Vibe instructions loaded from a trusted project folder.
- `.vibe/agents/web-development-coordinator.toml`: user-selectable lead agent.
- `.vibe/agents/*-specialist.toml` and `.vibe/agents/*-reviewer.toml`: delegation-only subagents spawned through Vibe's `task` tool.
- `.vibe/prompts/*.md`: prompt bodies referenced by each agent's `system_prompt_id`.
- `.vibe/skills/*/SKILL.md`: project Skills exposed as slash commands when `user-invocable: true`.

No MCP server, connector, hook, plugin, custom executable tool, provider profile, endpoint, telemetry setting, or install script is included.

## Installation and integration

Copy the contents of `mistral-vibe/web-development/` into the root of the target repository so these paths remain exact:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `.vibe/agents/*.toml`
- `.vibe/prompts/*.md`
- `.vibe/skills/*/SKILL.md`

Install and configure Vibe separately using official product instructions. Do not store credentials in this package. Start Vibe from the target repository root after the folder is trusted by Vibe. Verify discovery manually by confirming the `web-development-coordinator` agent is selectable and department Skills appear in slash-command autocomplete.

## How to use

Start the coordinator with:

```sh
vibe --agent web-development-coordinator
```

Inside an interactive session, Vibe can switch agents with its documented agent selector. Use Skills by their slash command names, for example `/stack-discovery`, `/workflow-plan-web-change`, `/frontend-delivery`, `/security-privacy-review`, or `/workflow-verify-release-readiness`. The coordinator may delegate read-only analysis to the configured subagents through `task` after approval when Vibe requests it.

Expected outputs are scoped plans, findings, recommendations, evidence summaries, and PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/NOT EXECUTED gate status for human review.

## Operating model

The coordinator confirms scope and acceptance criteria, discovers the stack from repository evidence, selects applicable specialists, reconciles findings, and reports final limitations. Specialists and reviewers return bounded text-only results with concrete evidence. Security/privacy and release readiness remain independent reviews and cannot be self-approved by implementers. Completion requires direct evidence; absent checks are reported as NOT EXECUTED.

## Examples

- Feature/architecture: ask with the Mistral Vibe coordinator to plan a passwordless login flow for the current web app. State: `Do not deploy or install packages.`
- Review/audit: request security/privacy review for CSP, cookies, CSRF, CORS, authorization, logging, third-party scripts, and sensitive data handling.
- Stack selection: provide repository evidence and ask the department to use only applicable Web Development specialists for React, Rails, Django, Laravel, static-site, or other detected stacks.
- Project customization: add `Node 22, pnpm only, WCAG 2.2 AA, LCP budget 2.5s, Playwright smoke tests` to task criteria without editing core department files.
- Sensitive action: request a deployment, publication, package-install, or Git checklist without executing it; actual external action requires separate human approval.

## Project-specific and user-specific configuration

Already specialized and normally not modified: Vibe agents, prompts, and Skills, review responsibilities, security/privacy responsibilities, accessibility/performance/SEO responsibilities, testing responsibilities, quality gates, and the operating model. Project/user values may include framework and runtime versions, package manager policy, repository layout, code style, lint/format/test commands, coverage thresholds, browser support matrix, WCAG target, performance budgets, Core Web Vitals thresholds, SEO requirements, API conventions, auth provider, database/storage technology, approved dependencies, deployment target, CI/CD commands, environment names, feature-flag conventions, observability provider, logging requirements, organization security policy, privacy/legal requirements, data classification, approval owners, release process, branch strategy, protected branches, allowed external integrations, MCP servers or connectors, private endpoints, organization IDs, and workspace IDs. Never hard-code or commit API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, production credentials, real secret values, or sensitive private URLs; use placeholders or environment-variable names. Project-specific configuration extends the department; it does not create the specialization.

## Safety and human approval

No automatic deployment, publication, authentication, secret use, spending, signing, submission, destructive operation, dependency installation, command execution, Git mutation, MCP use, connector use, or external side effect may occur without exact human authorization. Reviewer agents disable write and shell-capable tools. The coordinator has `task` set to ask for approval and disables shell, write, MCP, and connector tool patterns.

## Limitations

Validation for this package is static. Actual Vibe loading, model behavior, prompt routing, workspace policy, local model configuration, and provider authentication were not executed. Vibe CLI setup, trusted-folder state, account or API-plan availability, and VS Code extension behavior are user-environment dependent. Skills can expose write-capable tools for implementation workflows; humans must review those Skills and grant tool approvals according to the active Vibe session.

## Validation

- Syntax validation: TOML agent files and Skill YAML frontmatter parsed locally.
- Schema/static validation: agent prompt references, agent types, reviewer read-only configuration, and internal README paths checked locally.
- Actual product loading: NOT EXECUTED.
- Runtime tests: NOT EXECUTED.
- Browser/build/deployment checks: NOT EXECUTED.
