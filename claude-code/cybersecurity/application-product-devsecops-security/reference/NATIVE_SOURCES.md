## Decisions

- `CLAUDE.md` provides repository-scoped instructions.
- `.claude/agents/*.md` provides project subagents.
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` provides reusable Skills.
- MCP, hooks, and executable commands are omitted because this static package must not connect, execute, scan, or authenticate.
