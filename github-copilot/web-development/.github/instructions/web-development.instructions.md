# Web Development Quality Gates

For every gate, record **PASS**, **FAIL**, **BLOCKED**, or **NOT APPLICABLE** and the supporting evidence.

1. Scope and acceptance criteria are explicit and traceable.
2. The actual stack and existing conventions were verified.
3. Architecture and API contracts remain coherent and documented when materially changed.
4. Frontend behavior covers semantic structure, responsive states, errors, loading, empty states, keyboard and focus behavior where applicable.
5. Backend behavior covers validation, authorization, errors, idempotency, data integrity and observability where applicable.
6. Security and privacy review has no unresolved critical or high-risk finding.
7. CSP, CORS, cookies, CSRF, secrets, logging and third-party code were assessed where applicable.
8. Accessibility evidence covers applicable semantics, keyboard, focus, names, errors, contrast, zoom and motion.
9. Performance evidence covers applicable rendering, loading, caching, assets, server latency and budgets.
10. SEO evidence covers applicable metadata, indexability, canonical behavior, structured data and crawlability.
11. Tests and browser compatibility map to actual risk and supported targets.
12. Dependency and supply-chain changes are justified and human-reviewed.
13. Migrations, rollback, observability and operational documentation are adequate where applicable.
14. No automatic deployment, publication, Git mutation, installation, secret use or destructive action occurred.
15. An independent reviewer verified the final completion claim.

# Web Security and Human-Review Policy

## Mandatory human approval
Require explicit human approval before any action involving production, external systems, authentication or authorization behavior, cryptography, secrets, personal or sensitive data, database migrations, dependency changes, third-party scripts, analytics or tracking, payment or billing, infrastructure, DNS, certificates, signing, publication, deployment, merge, release or destructive operations.

## Default-deny external capability
No MCP server, connector, remote tool, browser automation, shell execution, plugin, provider, model endpoint or external integration is enabled by this package. Empty configuration objects are intentional. Users must review and configure integrations themselves.

## Review expectations
Use least privilege, secure defaults, defense in depth, server-side authorization, explicit validation, minimized data collection, bounded retention, safe logging, robust error handling and documented residual risk. A reviewer cannot approve their own implementation.
