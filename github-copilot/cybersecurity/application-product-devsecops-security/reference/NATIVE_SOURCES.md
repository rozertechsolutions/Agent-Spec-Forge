# Native Source Verification

Official GitHub Docs checked on 2026-07-15:

- Repository custom instructions: `https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/add-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions`
- Cloud agent environment customization: `https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/customize-the-agent-environment`
- Cloud agent MCP: `https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/customize-cloud-agent/extend-cloud-agent-with-mcp`

## Decisions

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is used for repository custom instructions.
- `.github/agents/*.agent.md` and `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` are used for native Copilot agent customization.
- MCP, Actions workflows, environment setup, hooks, executable scripts, and external integrations are omitted because this package is static and must not execute or connect anything.
