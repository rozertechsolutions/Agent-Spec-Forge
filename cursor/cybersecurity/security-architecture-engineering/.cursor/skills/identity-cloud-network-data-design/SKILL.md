# Identity, Cloud, Network, and Data Design

Objective: create or review architecture designs for identity, cloud/platform, network, endpoint/workspace, data protection, and cryptographic control domains.

Primary owner: `identity-cloud-network-agent` for identity/cloud/network/endpoint outputs; `data-container-automation-agent` for data protection, cryptography, and protected material outputs.

Inputs: identity sources, privilege model, platform scope, management planes, network zones, communication paths, endpoint profiles, data classes, cryptographic requirements, ownership boundaries, source evidence, and approval path.

Workflow:

1. Confirm authorized scope, owner, reviewer, approver, source versions, evidence limitations, and decision needed.
2. Map identities, privileges, administrative paths, trust zones, data classes, interfaces, and management planes.
3. Define target controls, inherited controls, boundary controls, monitoring handoff expectations, and failure modes.
4. Document design findings, required changes, recommended patterns, dependencies, residual risk, and human-only decisions.
5. Produce implementation handoff criteria without granting access, configuring controls, or handling real sensitive material.
6. Route high-impact designs to `independent-architecture-reviewer`.

Outputs: IAM/PAM architecture, cloud/platform model, segmentation design, secure communications pattern, endpoint/workspace control placement, data protection design, cryptography design note, residual risk, assumptions, limitations, and approval state.

Stop conditions: privileged access approval, key authority decision, production control operation, tenant/network change, sensitive material exposure, or deployment.
