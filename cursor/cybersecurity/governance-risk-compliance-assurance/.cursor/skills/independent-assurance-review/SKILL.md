# Independent Assurance Review

Objective: review cybersecurity GRC artifacts for correctness, completeness, evidence quality, ownership clarity, approval gates, and residual risk.

Primary owner: `independent-assurance-reviewer`.

Inputs: draft artifact, source evidence list, criteria, owner, creator, intended audience, decision needed, approval path, and completion criteria.

Workflow:

1. Confirm the reviewer did not create the artifact under review.
2. Check scope, exclusions, evidence provenance, assumptions, confidence, limitations, and completeness.
3. Validate ownership, requirement/control mapping, risk logic, treatment or remediation quality, and human-only decision gates.
4. Identify blockers, material gaps, unsupported claims, ambiguity, and residual risk.
5. Return findings by severity with required corrections and optional improvements.

Outputs: independent review report, approval blockers, required corrections, unresolved questions, and readiness recommendation.

Stop conditions: self-review, missing evidence, request to approve the artifact, compliance/certification claim, secret or personal data exposure, or unresolved human-only decision.
